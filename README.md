# DealBase

## Base Idea

```
From my previous work experience at a debt capital FinTech company, it became evident that the debt capital industry has ample room for tech innovation and there were many aspects of the industry that were running on outdated technology or no centralized technology.

One of the major areas that seemed to be lagging behind in the technological sphere was the way that borrowers and loan institutions connected. The current system seems to be mostly based on Private equity firms sending out emails to loan institutions and having long back and forths with loan officers determining if the loan structure and sector fits the loan institutionâ€™s box. This process could take over a week just to figure out if the borrowers and loan officers are in the same areas even before the loan officers start to look into the financials of the borrower and sign a NDA. Along with this the borrower would have to reach out via email to lots of loan institutions at a time to see what institutions had a base interest in the loan, which takes valuable hours. Loans are also passed from one institution to another until they find someone interested in the loan, but with each pass comes added referral fees.

DealBase is a MVP deal centralization platform that allows firms to post the base metrics of their company and loan to allow loan officers a one stop shop for loans. The base idea is that borrowers will put in the base information about their company and loan, which will be generalized and anonymized to a base ranges on a table. From this table, loan officers can sort through the anonymized loan application data to find loans that fit their box and key financial metrics they are looking for. From there, they can click on the loan in the table to get a more full understanding of the loan metrics and get the contact information of the borrower, so they can continue the conversation via email or phone from there.

Future steps of this project would be filters on the table to allow for better filtration of deals, such as industry filter, min and max financial metrics, or loan size. Another future step would be the DealStats page. On this page, a person could get aggregated data on loans based on deals filtered to allow better insight into the financial ranges and loan asks of companies.
